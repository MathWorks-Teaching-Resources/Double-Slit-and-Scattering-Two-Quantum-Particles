# Double-Slit-and-Scattering-Two-Quantum-Particles
MATLAB&reg; Live Script contains simulations and visualizations of quantum mechanics problems such as: 
double slit experiment and scattering problem of two quantum particles, providing examples on how computation 
can help teaching/ studying fundamentals of quantum mechanics. These two problems covered in the Live script are 
computationally similar, but conceptually different problems: simulating dynamics of a quantum particle in two dimensions (2D) 
and simulating scattering of two interacting particles off each-other in 1D.
The first part of this Live script is a mixture of quantum mechanics basics that lead to simulations of a single paricle's wavefunction's 
time evolution in a double-slit geometry. To reduce computational complexity we consider a 2D case. Note that this is not an unrealistic situation; 
for example in experiments on ultracold quantum gases geometrically constrained systems (icluding 2D and 1D systems) are often realized.
The second part of the Live script is dedicated to the basics of many-body quantum mechanics, leading to the simulation of the dynamics of two interacting 
particles in 1D. Live script is organized in sections and is self explanatory.
